# bseq-kit

## Overview 

***bseq-kit*** is a mini-program that allows the user to work with nucleotide and amino acid sequences, as well as fastq format data. This tool contains three semantic and functional blocks:

#### :round_pushpin: run_dna_rna_tools
Block for working with nucleotide sequences. It can converts a DNA/RNA sequence into its reverse, complement, reverse-complement form, or translate to its trancribe form.

#### :round_pushpin: run_amino_acid_tools
Block for working with amino acid sequences. Calculates the molecular weight of a sequence or its amino acid composition.

#### :round_pushpin: run_fastq_tools
Block for working with fastq format. Filters fastq-sequences based on user-specified conditions.

## Usage

To use AminoAcidTools simply import `run_bseq` into your `*.py` script as shown below:
```python
import run_bseq
```
And then run the required function, adding its name and input arguments after the dot, for example:
```python
run_bseq.run_dna_rna_tools('ATgC', operation = 'complement')  # command

'TAcG'  # result
```

### :inbox_tray: Input

#### run_dna_rna_tools

The program has two required input parameters:
* Nucleotide sequence(s), variable argument. Sequences to be analyzed are **not** case-specific (`str` type);
* `operation = 'option'` Name of the operation to be executed, keyword argument (`str` type):

```python
run_bseq.run_dna_rna_tools('AGTtC', 'GTT', operation = 'reverse')  # correct
```

:exclamation: You must use one of predefined operation names described in the "Options" section below.

#### run_amino_acid_tools

The program has two required input parameters:
* Aminoacid sequence(s), variable argument. The amino acid sequence must be written in single-letter form and in uppercase (`str` type);
* `operation = 'option'` Name of the operation to be executed, keyword argument (`str` type):

```python
run_bseq.run_amino_acid_tools('ARDF', operation = 'calculate_molecular_weight')  # correct
```

:exclamation: You must use one of predefined operation names described in the "Options" section below.

#### run_fastq_tools

The program has one required input parameter:
* `seqs` Fastq-sequences, variable argument. The *key* is the name of the sequences. The *value* is a tuple of two strings: sequence and quality  (`dict` type). 

The remaining arguments indicate filtering conditions. For filtering parameters you can leave the default values or change it.  Operation to filtering described in the "Options" section below.

```python
run_bseq.run_fastq_tools(seqs = {
    # 'name' : ('sequence', 'quality')
   '@SRX079804:1:SRR292678:1:1101:21885:21885': ('ACAGCAACATAAACATGATGGGATGGCGTAAGCCCCCGAGATATCAGTTTACCCAGGATAAGAGATTAAATTATGAGCAACATTATTAA', 'FGGGFGGGFGGGFGDFGCEBB@CCDFDDFFFFBFFGFGEFDFFFF;D@DD>C@DDGGGDFGDGG?GFGFEGFGGEF@FDGGGFGFBGGD'),
    '@SRX079804:1:SRR292678:1:1101:24563:24563': ('ATTAGCGAGGAGGAGTGCTGAGAAGATGTCGCCTACGCCGTTGAAATTCCCTTCAATCAGGGGGTACTGGAGGATACGAGTTTGTGTG', 'BFFFFFFFB@B@A<@D>BDDACDDDEBEDEFFFBFFFEFFDFFF=CC@DDFD8FFFFFFF8/+.2,@7<<:?B/:<><-><@.A*C>D'),

    }, gc_bounds = (20, 50), length_bounds = (90), quality_threshold = 30)  # correct
```


### :outbox_tray: Output

#### run_dna_rna_tools

`str` If one sequence is given as input, `list` if two or more sequences are submitted:

```python
run_bseq.run_dna_rna_tools('AGTtC', 'GTT', operation = 'reverse')
['CtTGA', 'TTG']

run_bseq.run_dna_rna_tools('GGTca', operation = 'transcribe')
'GGUca'
```

#### run_amino_acid_tools

`list` For both one and several arguments. 
*Please note*, when using the `calculate_amino_acid_percentage` operation, a `list[dict]` is always returned as output:

```python
run_bseq.run_amino_acid_tools('ARDF', operation = 'calculate_amino_acid_percentage')
[{'A': 25.0, 'R': 25.0, 'D': 25.0, 'F': 25.0}]

run_bseq.run_amino_acid_tools('ARDF', operation = 'calculate_molecular_weight')  
[507.54]
```

#### run_fastq_tools

`dict` which consisting only of those sequences that passed all the specified conditions: 

```python
run_bseq.run_fastq_tools(seqs = {
    # 'name' : ('sequence', 'quality')

## Options

Each program block contains its own implementable operations.


#### run_dna_rna_tools  

 -   `transcribe`  
 
Convert nucleotide (DNA/RNA) sequence into its transcribe form.
*Please note*, entering an RNA sequence to run this operation will produce the original sequence.

-   `reverse`  

Convert nucleotide (DNA/RNA) sequence into reverse sequence.

-   `complement`  

Convert nucleotide (DNA/RNA) sequence into complement sequence.

-   `reverse_complement`  

Convert nucleotide (DNA/RNA) sequence into complement sequence and reverse it.

#### run_amino_acid_tools  

-   `calculate_molecular_weight`

Calculate the molecular weight of the input amino acid sequences based on the mass of each amino acid residue. Reference values for the masses of amino acid residues are taken from [The University of Washington's Proteomics Resource (UWPR)](https://proteomicsresource.washington.edu/protocols06/masses.php) and rounded to three decimal places. The calculations took into account the presence of *H* and *OH* groups at the termini of the sequences. The output is molecular weight of sequence in Daltons (the result is rounded to two decimal places).

-   `calculate_amino_acid_percentage`  

Calculate the percentage of each amino acid in the sequence. The input is a string with amino acid sequence. The output is the percentage of each amino acid in the sequence (the result is rounded to two decimal places).

- `calculate_pI`

Calculate the isoelectric point of amino acid sequences. The function operation is based on the formula for determining the isoelectric point:

$$pI = \dfrac{(pK_1 + pK_2 + ... + pK_n)}{n},$$

where $pK$ is dissociation constant of free $NH_2$ and $COOH$ radicals in amino acids.
The output is the value of the isoelectric point of aminoacids sequence (the result is rounded to two decimal places).

- `calculate_hydrophobicity_eisenberg`

Calculate estimation of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of amino acid sequences. The function operation is based on the Einzenberg hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity scale of amino acids. The output is the rough estimate of the hydrophobicity of aminoacids sequence (the result is rounded to two decimal places). A value less than 0 indicates hydrophobicity; a value greater than 0 indicates hydrophilicity.

#### run_fastq_tools  

-   `gc_bounds`  

Composition GC interval (in percent) for filtering. Default is `tuple` (0, 100). When passing a single number as an argument, it is considered an upper bound. For example, `gc_bounds = (20, 80)` save only reads with GC content from 20 to 80%, `gc_bounds = 50`  save reads with GC content less than or equal to 50%.
:exclamation: When specifying only the upper bound, use `int` or `float`

-   `length_bounds` 

Length interval for filtering.  Default is `tuple` (0, 2**32). When passing a single number as an argument, it is considered an upper bound. For example, `length_bounds = (150, 500)` save only reads with length from 150 to 500 bp, `length_bounds = 400`  save reads with length less than or equal to 400 bp.
:exclamation: When specifying only the upper bound, use `int` or `float`

-   `quality_threshold` 

The threshold value of average read quality for filtering. Default is 0 (`int`) in Phred33 scale. Reads with average quality across all nucleotides **below** the threshold will be discarded.

## Troubleshooting

For `run_dna_rna_tools`, the program automatically checks whether the input is nucleotide sequence (contains only letters *A*, *T*, *G*, *C*, *U* in any case and not *T* and *U* together). 
For `run_amino_acid_tools` the correctness of the amino acid sequence is checked (whether it contains only letters corresponding to one-letter amino acid abbreviations).
The name of the operation is also checked. If an error is detected, the program will be interrupted and a corresponding message will be displayed on the screen:

```python
run_bseq.run_dna_rna_tools('AGTUU', operation = 'reverse')  # incorrect input sequence
ValueError: Incorrect sequence

run_bseq.run_amino_acid_tools('ARDF', operation = 'percentage')  # incorrect operation
ValueError: Incorrect operation
```
